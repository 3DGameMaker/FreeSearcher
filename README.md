#THIS IS BEING FALSELEY FLAGGED BY AV VENDORS. No idea why this is happening, all the exe does is call a batch script. The only way to help is to submit our file to your AV provider, and hope they can whitelist it. (if you can't be bothered to fix your av, run start.bat, however it is a hidden file and hides whenever you update so this can be quite a hassle)

A simple windows CLI application for accessing ripped media. These are all checked by us, and are 100% safe.

-THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS!-

## Installation

OS X:

> Not Currently Supported

Linux:

Download the files and extract them to your desired location

Then cd to that location in terminal.

Then make the file executable using
>  chmod u+x Main.sh

To run the program, while in the directory of install, run:

> ./Main.sh

Or open Main.sh in your file manager

Windows:

> Unzip the file and run searcher.exe (if you can't be bothered to fix your av, run start.bat)

Example command:
```
search-manga-one-piece.volumes-1
```
This will download One Piece volume 1.
